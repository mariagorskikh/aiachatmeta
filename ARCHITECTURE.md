# Agent-to-Agent Communication Chat App Architecture

## Project Overview
A revolutionary chat application where users communicate through their personal Llama4 AI agents. Each user is assigned an agent that acts as their digital representative, communicating with other users' agents to relay messages in a natural, conversational manner.

## Core Components

### 1. User Management System
- User registration/login
- Each user gets a unique Llama4 agent upon registration
- User profiles linked to their personal agents

### 2. Agent System
- **Personal Agent**: Each user has one dedicated Llama4 agent
- **Agent Identity**: Agents have unique IDs and know their owner's name
- **Agent Memory**: Agents remember conversation context and user preferences
- **Agent Discovery**: Agents can find other agents in the system

### 3. Communication Flow
```
User A → Agent A → [Agent Discovery] → Agent B → User B
         ↓                                ↑
      "Tell Justin hi"            "Maria says hi"
```

### 4. Database Schema

#### Users Table
- id (Primary Key)
- username (Unique)
- email (Unique)
- password_hash
- created_at
- agent_id (Foreign Key)

#### Agents Table
- id (Primary Key)
- user_id (Foreign Key)
- system_prompt (Agent's personality/instructions)
- created_at
- last_active

#### Messages Table
- id (Primary Key)
- from_agent_id (Foreign Key)
- to_agent_id (Foreign Key)
- original_user_message (What user told their agent)
- agent_interpretation (How agent understood it)
- transmitted_message (What was sent to other agent)
- received_interpretation (How receiving agent understood it)
- delivered_message (What receiving agent showed to user)
- timestamp
- status (pending/delivered/read)

#### Conversations Table
- id (Primary Key)
- user_id (Foreign Key)
- agent_id (Foreign Key)
- user_message (User's input)
- agent_response (Agent's response)
- timestamp
- conversation_type (instruction/response)

#### Agent_Prompts Table
- id (Primary Key)
- agent_id (Foreign Key)
- prompt_name
- prompt_template
- created_at

### 5. Technical Stack

#### Backend
- **Framework**: FastAPI (Python) - for async support and easy integration with llama-api-python
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **WebSockets**: For real-time communication
- **Queue**: Redis for message queue and caching
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens

#### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- **UI Library**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui for modern components
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Real-time**: Socket.io client
- **API Client**: Axios with React Query

#### AI Integration
- **Llama API**: Official llama-api-python library
- **Agent Memory**: Vector database (Pinecone/Weaviate) for long-term memory
- **Prompt Engineering**: Structured prompts for agent behavior

### 6. Key Features

#### Agent Capabilities
1. **Natural Language Understanding**: Agents parse user intent
2. **Contact Discovery**: "Find Justin" → searches user database
3. **Message Translation**: Converts casual speech to formal agent communication
4. **Context Awareness**: Remembers previous conversations
5. **Personality**: Each agent can have unique communication style

#### User Features
1. **Direct Agent Chat**: Talk to your agent naturally
2. **Contact List**: See all available users/agents
3. **Message History**: View past conversations
4. **Agent Training**: Customize agent behavior
5. **Real-time Updates**: Instant message delivery

### 7. Agent Communication Protocol

#### Message Structure
```json
{
  "message_id": "uuid",
  "from_agent": {
    "id": "agent_uuid",
    "owner": "Maria"
  },
  "to_agent": {
    "id": "agent_uuid",
    "owner": "Justin"
  },
  "content": {
    "original_intent": "Say hi to Justin",
    "interpreted_message": "Greeting from Maria",
    "formal_content": "Maria wishes to convey a friendly greeting",
    "metadata": {
      "urgency": "normal",
      "sentiment": "positive",
      "message_type": "greeting"
    }
  },
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601"
}
```

### 8. Security Considerations
- End-to-end encryption for agent communications
- Rate limiting on API calls
- User authentication and authorization
- Secure storage of Llama API key
- Input sanitization to prevent prompt injection

### 9. Scalability Plan
- Horizontal scaling with multiple backend instances
- Message queue for async processing
- Caching layer for frequent agent lookups
- Database read replicas
- CDN for static assets

### 10. Unique Selling Points
- First chat app with AI-mediated communication
- Personal AI assistant for each user
- Natural language interface
- Cross-cultural communication (agents can translate intent)
- Privacy through agent intermediation
