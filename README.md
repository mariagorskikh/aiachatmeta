# AIA Chat: Advanced Agent-to-Agent Communication Platform

**Next-generation messaging through intelligent AI intermediaries**

AIA Chat reimagines human communication by introducing Agent-to-Agent (A2A) messaging, where AI agents serve as intelligent intermediaries that enhance, transform, and optimize conversations between users. Built with Meta's Llama4 model at its core.

## The A2A Communication Paradigm

Traditional messaging sends messages directly between users. AIA Chat introduces a new layer: your personal AI agent analyzes your intent, transforms your message to match your desired communication style, and delivers it through the recipient's agent for optimal understanding.

**Communication Flow:**
```
User → Personal Agent (Llama4) → Message Transformation → Recipient Agent → User
```

### Core Capabilities

**Intelligent Message Transformation**
- **Smart Mode**: Enhanced vocabulary and sophisticated phrasing
- **Professional**: Business-appropriate language and tone
- **Casual**: Relaxed, friendly communication style
- **Diplomatic**: Tactful and constructive messaging
- **Witty**: Subtle humor and clever phrasing
- **Custom**: Personalized transformation prompts

**Real-time Processing**
- Sub-second message transformation using Llama4
- Context-aware communication that maintains conversation flow
- Adaptive learning from interaction patterns

**Privacy-First Design**
- Messages are transformed in real-time, not stored
- End-to-end agent mediation
- Secure authentication with multiple provider support

## Technical Architecture

**Backend Infrastructure**
- FastAPI with async processing for real-time A2A communication
- SQLAlchemy ORM with SQLite/PostgreSQL support
- JWT authentication with Google OAuth integration
- WebSocket-ready architecture with intelligent polling fallback

**Frontend Experience**
- Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- Modern React Query for data synchronization
- Zustand for efficient state management
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

**AI Integration**
- Meta Llama4 model for sophisticated language processing
- Context-aware message transformation
- Configurable personality and communication styles

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- Llama4 API access

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp env.example .env
# Add your API credentials to .env

# Launch backend server
PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```

**Access Points:**
- Application: http://localhost:3001
- API: http://localhost:8000
